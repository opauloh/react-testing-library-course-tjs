### notes

- @testing-library/jest-dom : The Jest DOM library provides really useful
  extensions to jestâ€™s built-in assertion library that will make it easier for
  us to write our test assertions, also make the error messages more easy to
  understand. You can extend expect to use it:

  ```js
  import {toHaveAttribute} from '@testing-library/jest-dom'

  expect.extend({toHaveAttribute})
  ```

  ... or extend everything:

  ```js
  import * as jestDOM from '@testing-library/jest-dom'

  expect.extend(jestDOM)
  ```

  ... or import like this:

  ```js
  import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'
  ```

Also, you can check in the docs for all currently available assertion methods:
(https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)[https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom]

- We can get our elements in a less imperative way, like for example using

```js
const input = screen.getByLabelText(/favorite number/i)
```

- We can use regex to let our tests more flexible, like that:
  `/favorite number/i`, the "i", stands for insensitive case, because in this
  case the user is not impacted by the case of the label texts, and if we decide
  to change it, we don't need to rewrite our tests:

```js
const input = screen.getByLabelText(/favorite number/i)
expect(input).toHaveAttribute('type', 'number')
```

- Debug allows us to inspect how the code looks like, at a specific point, and
  we can use it like that:

```js
const {debug} = render(<FavoriteNumber />)
debug(input)
```

It defaults to the container where all of our queries are bound to, or it will
print out the DOM node that we pass to it, making it much easier to develop our
tests

- testing-library/react provides us the **fireEvent** API, and this allows us to
  fire an event on the element that we want to test:

```js
test('entering an invalid value shows an error message', () => {
  render(<FavoriteNumber />)
  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/favorite number/i)
  fireEvent.change(input, {
    target: {
      value: '10',
    },
  })
  expect(screen.getByRole('alert')).toHaveTextContent(/the number is invalid/i)
})
```

in the above scenario we fired an on change event in the input, with the options
target.value equals to 10
